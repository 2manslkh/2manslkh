### EtherCard - Contactless Crypto Payments (Scaling Ethereum 2023)

Ethercard is a revolutionary payment solution that allows individuals and business owners to easily and securely receive cryptocurrency payments using NFC technology. With Ethercard, the receiver can request payments on their mobile device, and the sender can tap their Ethercard, which is a physical card embedded with an NFC chip linked to their crypto wallet. This acts as the "signature" to approve the transaction, making payments seamless and secure.

Our product solves the problem of complicated and error-prone crypto payments by simplifying the process without compromising security. We wanted to answer the question: “How might we simplify crypto payments for more users without compromising security?”. Ethercard is designed to be user-friendly, with a mobile app that enables users to request and receive crypto with just a few taps. Using ZK and account abstraction ensures that payments are safe and secure.

Ethercard is perfect for small business owners like Jorge (our user persona in the demo video), who can now easily accept crypto payments without the hassle of traditional payment systems. With our cutting-edge technology, you can rest assured that your payments are transparent and secure.

For future improvements, we would like to enable phone-to-phone payments so users can tap their phones with others to send/receive payments. In addition, we want to support 100+ cryptocurrencies in addition to ETH.

Join us in the future of payments with Ethercard!

### BluebirdSwap - On-chain Fractionalised NFT Options Trading  (ETHDenver #BUIDLathon 2023)

<i>🏆 The Graph — Best New Subgraph(s)</i>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2manslkh/2manslkh/main/img/bluebirdswap.png" width=400/>

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have become increasingly popular in recent years as a way to represent unique digital assets such as artwork, music, and video game items. However, high-value NFTs can be expensive and illiquid, making it difficult for smaller investors to gain exposure to the market.

With BluebirdSwap, users can buy and sell fractional ownership of NFTs, which makes it possible for smaller investors to participate in the market. This allows users to buy a share of a valuable NFT without having to pay the entire price upfront. Fractional ownership also allows investors to diversify their portfolios by owning a stake in multiple NFTs. BluebirdSwap provides a new way to speculate on the value of these assets. This is not possible on OpenSea or other NFT marketplaces, which only support direct trading of NFTs.

In addition to fractionalized NFTs, BluebirdSwap also offers an options trading platform for NFTs. Users can buy calls or puts on fractionalized NFTs, which allows them to potentially profit from price movements without having to buy the entire asset. This provides flexibility and risk management for investors who may not want to take on the full risk of owning an entire NFT. The premium for the options contracts is paid in the specific fractionalized NFT tokens.

Modern day social media is plagued with ads and people sending unsolicited messages to strangers due to the ease of doing so via bots and automation. We feel that it is unfair that you have to waste your precious attention on spam and unwanted messages.

Ad services such as Google Ad sense helps you to monetize your attention to a certain degree, but what if we could democratize this whole process?

There are existing solutions out there to do exactly this, such as the Brave browser, but there has not been one in the area of text messaging.

### 🚫◼️✏️ Unblogged - Censorship Resistant Blogging (HackFS 2022)

<i>🏆 IPFS/Filecoin Sponsor Prize</i>

<a href="https://github.com/Unblogg">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unblogg/.github/main/profile/assets/unblogged_logo.jpg"  width=400/>
</a>

Blogging + Unblocking Censorship = Unblogged. Unblogged was submitted as a hackathon project for HackFS 2022.

Unblogged is a blogging application that unblocks any form of censorship (Blog + Unblock = Unblogged). It utilizes IPFS to keep user's articles persistent and censorship resistant and Markdown language for a pleasant and familiar writing interface.

Our team's goal for this hackathon is to develop a 100% decentralized platform using the power of IPFS, hence, all the tools used to support this platform is completely decentralized. Unblogged is hosted using [Fleek](https://github.com/FleekHQ), which allows **Unblogged** to be permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant, and free of centralized gatekeepers. Every article that a user writes will be published and pinned on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) using [web3.storage's](https://github.com/web3-storage) SDK. This means that the user's article would be almost impossible to be censored. Each article is also minted as an NFT on Polygon which is integrated with [Tableland](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork) such that every article can be searched (using a simple SQL query) on the Homepage of Unblogged by the article's title or tags.

### :gift: PEW - On-Chain Reputation Governance (ETH NYC 2022)

<i>🏆 Worldcoin Pool Prize</i> <i>🏆 Optimism Pool Prize</i>

<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/Unblogg">
<img src="img/pew.png"  width=400/>
</a>

The project was submitted as part of ETHNYC 2022 organized by ETHGlobal. Current governance modals that uses tokens as voting power suffer from voting inequality. Rich users that may not have the best interest of the DAO in mind can easily pass proposals that are in their favour instead of the DAO.

PEW aims to solve this voting issue by introducing an on-chain reputation system that is fully democratized. Individuals have to self-declare their contributions to the DAO which are either vouched or refuted via Upvoting or downvoting respectively. The overall voting power an individual have will be:

$A * Time\ Spent\ In\ DAO * B * Total\ Number\ Of\ Upvotes * C * Total\ Number\ Of\ Downvotes * D * Total\ Number\ Of\ Reviews\ Given$

where A, B, C, and D are customizable weights.

### :gift: Nifty Rewards - NFT Reward Discovery Platform (ETH Amsterdam 2022)

<i>🏆 Web3 Auth Sponsor Prize</i>

<p align="center">

<img src="img/nifty.png"  width=500/>
</a>

The project was submitted as part of ETHAmsterdam 2022 organized by ETHGlobal. Our group identified a key problem with NFTs and it is the struggle for teams to provide utilities. A fully digital metaverse is not here yet and people will always still seek comfort in tangible real world utilities. Today, we have millions of brands and services out there looking for consumers but there is no easy way for them to tap on the users and liquidity accumulated in the NFT ecosystem.

Bigger brands like Nike and Adidas have the purchasing power to acquire successful NFT collections but what about the 99% of merchants out there?

Over the 36-hours hackathon, my team prototyped a which platform serves as a Discovery Reward platform for users and a one-stop platform for merchants to kickstart nft reward campaigns. Onboarding web2 users and merchants is seamless with the use of technologies like web3Auth and walletConnect.

<img src="img/breeding.gif" width="100">

Breeding smart contract where users can use their Gen 1 UUs to breed Gen 2 UUs. Breeding logic is done off-chain to save gas costs. All the traits of the Gen 1 UUs were mapped and stored in a MongoDB server into a chromosome type model. On token mint, backend logic takes in 2 of such chromosomes to output a baby Gen 2 UU that inherits the parent's traits with a random mutation chance. Heroku was used to host the backend API.
